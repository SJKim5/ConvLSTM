# ConvLSTM

# Project Title

This repository contains Python scripts converted from Jupyter notebooks that are focused on data analysis and ConvLSTM (Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory) modeling. These scripts aim to simplify spatiotemporal prediction using deep learning techniques and explore various data-related tasks.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `01.Data.py`
This script was converted from a Jupyter notebook and is designed for data analysis tasks. It includes:
- Loading and preprocessing of data.
- Data exploration and visualization.
- Potential machine learning models (if any) for predictive analytics.

### 2. `03.ConvLSTM.py`
This script focuses on spatiotemporal predictions using a ConvLSTM architecture. It contains:
- Data preprocessing steps specifically for time series and spatial data.
- Model architecture for ConvLSTM.
- Training and evaluation of the ConvLSTM model.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you will need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

Additional libraries might be needed based on specific parts of the code (e.g., for data visualization or advanced metrics).
